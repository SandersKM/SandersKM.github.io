# Teaching

## Academic

**Data Structures, Teaching assistant**   
*Hendrix College*, Conway, AR (Spring 2018)

I was a TA for the 3 hour weekly labratory portion of the data structures class. I also tutored students from several computer science classes weekly for 2 hours. 
When students had trouble implementing complex data structures in Java, I answered conceptual questions and helped with debugging. I also gave advice to students tackeling large independent projects.


**Foundations of Computer Science, Teaching assistant**    
*Hendrix College*, Conway, AR (Fall 2017)

I was a TA for the labratory portion of the introductory computer science class at Hendrix. In addition to answering questions during labs for 3 hours per week, I also hosted tutoring hours weekly for 2 hours. 
I assisted the students in mastering the basics of programming in Python, guiding them through the logic and debugging skills required to complete projects.
