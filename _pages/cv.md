# Education

**Hendrix College**, B.A. in Computer Science & Mathematics (expected 2020)   
**Batesville High School** (2016)   

***

# Research experience

**Undergraduate Research Odyssey**, Hendrix College (Fall 2018)
*Under the direction of [Dr. Adam Schneider](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4uliMTwAAAAJ&hl=en#)*

I am studying the parasitic plant Dwarf Mistletoe (Arceuthobium). I built a pipeline for assembling Arceuthobium platomes from Illumina Sequencing data. We are using these assemblies to construct a more accurate molecular phylogeny of Arceuthobium. 

**Broad Summer Research Program**, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (Summer 2018)         
[Greka Lab](http://grekalab.bwh.harvard.edu/people/), *Under the direction of [Dr. Jamie Marshall](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/jamie-marshall)* 

At the Broad Institute, I created a user-friendly pipeline to identify potentially pathogenic gene variants associated with Kidney Disease. This pipeline significantly reduces the time researchers must spend searching for gene variants online, thereby increasing the time that can be spent conducting experiments in the lab. 

**Undergraduate Research Odyssey**, Hendrix College (Spring 2018)           
*Under the direction of [Dr. Lindsay Kennedy](https://www.hendrix.edu/psychology/psychology.aspx?id=54453)* 

I created a pipeline in R for analyzing results of the Hendrix Well Being Survey. After exploring group differences between well-being measures, I compiled a report and presented my findings to Hendrix faculty and students. 

**ProHealth REU**,  Indiana University Bloomington (Summer 2018)          
[StARLinG Lab](https://starling.utdallas.edu/), *Under the direction of [Dr. Sriraam Natarajan](http://utdallas.edu/~sriraam.natarajan/)* 

I participated in the ProHealth REU the summer after my freshman year. While there, I explored novel interactions between heart disease risk factors using Bayesian networks. 


**Research Assistant**, Lyon College (Summer 2015)       
*Under the direction of [Dr. Cassia Oliveira](https://www.lyon.edu/cassiaoliveira)*

I assisted with Dr. Oliviera's research in 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis of Ozark cave bacteria the summer before my senior year of high school. During this time I helped gather and grow cave bacteria, perform RNA extraction, and analyze sequencing results. [Read more](/portfolio/Research-Lyon/).

# Teaching

## Academic

**Computer Science, Teaching Assistant**    
*Hendrix College*, Conway, AR (Fall 2017 - Present)

I am a Teaching Assistant for the laboratory portion of the introductory computer science classes at Hendrix. In addition to answering questions during labs, I host tutoring hours weekly. I have assisted the students in mastering the basics of programming in Python and Java, guiding them through the logic and debugging skills required to complete projects.

**Genetics, Peer Learning Assistant**    
*Hendrix College*, Conway, AR (Spring 2019 - Present)

I host tutoring hours every week for the Genetics course. During this time, I assist students in understanding course concepts, completing homework assignments, and reviewing for tests.
