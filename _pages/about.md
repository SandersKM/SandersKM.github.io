I'm a junior at Hendrix College studying Computer Science and Mathematics. My primary research interest is in creating **data-driven models** of biological phenomenon. I take every opportunity I get to pursue computational biology research, whether it is at Hendrix College, Lyon College, Indiana University, or the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

Wherever I go, **I get things done**. In high school, this meant starting a non-profit to address the needs of homeless families in Batesville and working with the Superintendent to address traffic problems by building a new road at the school. At Hendrix College, I have worked with the Climate Action Committee to compute the distances staff commute to the campus. I also founded a Computer Science Club at Hendrix to build community, promote professional development, and take part in outreach activities.

When I am not doing those things, I am probably at **choir** practice or performing. I am passionate about the collaboration that goes into learning difficult music. My favorite choir was Compline at Hendrix, a very small student led a capella group. You can listen to some of our podcasts [here](https://complineathendrix.org/).
