I'm a junior at Hendrix College studying Computer Science and Mathematics. My primary research interest is in creating **data driven models** of biological phenomenon. I take every oppurtunity I get to pursue computational biology research, whether it is at Hendrix College, Lyon College, Indiana University, or the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. 

Wherever I go, I **get things done**. In high school, this meant starting a non-profit to address the needs of homeless families in Batesville and working with the Superintendent to adress traffic problems by building a new road at the school. At Hendrix College, I have worked with the Climate Action Comittee to compute the distances staff comute to the campus. I also founded a Computer Science Club at Hendrix to build community, promote professional development, and take part in outreach activities. 

When I am not doing those things, I amhttps://complineathendrix.org/ probably at **choir** practice or performing. I am passionate about the collaboration that goes into learning difficult music.  My favourite choir was Compline at Hendrix, a very small student led a capella group. You can listen to some of our podcasts [here](https://complineathendrix.org/).
