I am a senior Computer Science and Mathematics major at [Hendrix College](https://www.hendrix.edu/). My passion lies at the intersection of biology and technology - I want to create software that revolutionizes medical research. 

When I'm not coding, I have enjoyed helping others develop a passion for computer science as a teacher's assistant for six semesters. I also founded a Computer Science Club at Hendrix to build community, promote professional development, and take part in outreach activities.
